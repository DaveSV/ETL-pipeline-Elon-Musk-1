2021-01-07 10:24:29+00:00,"As seen from an external observer, not the participants"
2021-01-07 10:23:50+00:00,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely

2021-01-02 14:59:09+00:00,@flcnhvy Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
2021-01-02 14:51:49+00:00,"So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all."
2021-01-02 12:23:28+00:00,"@newscientist Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance"
2021-01-02 03:20:48+00:00,"@comma_ai Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can‚Äôt speak for regulators though."
2021-01-01 00:58:30+00:00,"@PPathole Dojo isn‚Äôt needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn‚Äôt enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers."
